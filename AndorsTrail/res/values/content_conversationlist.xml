{unzel_10|Vacor and I used to travel together. But he started to get obsessed with his spell making.|||{{N|unzel_11||||}}|};

{flagstone_sentry_8|For years, no one took notice of Flagstone. Except for the occasional reports from travelers of terrible screams coming from the camp.|||{{N|flagstone_sentry_9||||}}|};

{umar_novisit_1|Hello. How did your search go?|||{{What search?|umar_2||||}}|};
{umar_2|Last time we talked, you asked for the way to Lodar\'s Hideaway. Did you find it?|||{{We have never met.|umar_3||||}{You must have me confused with my brother Andor. We look very much alike.|umar_4||||}}|};
{umar_3|Oh. I must have you mixed up with someone else.|||{{My brother Andor and I look very much alike.|umar_4||||}}|};
{umar_4|Really? Never mind I said anything then.|andor:51||{{I guess that means that Andor was here. What was he doing?|umar_5||||}}|};
{umar_5|He came here a while ago, asking a lot of questions about what relation the Thieves Guild has to the Shadow and to the royal guard in Feygard.|||{{N|umar_6||||}}|};
{umar_6|We in the Thieves Guild really don\'t care much for the Shadow. Nor do we care for the royal guard.|||{{N|umar_7||||}}|};
{umar_7|We try to be above their bickering and differences. They may fight as much as they want, but the Thieves Guild will outlive them all.|||{{What conflict?|umar_conflict_1||||}{Tell me more about what Andor asked for|umar_andor_1||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_1|Where have you been the last couple of years? Don\'t you know of the brewing conflict?|||{{N|umar_conflict_2||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_2|The royal guard, led by Lord Geomyr in Feygard, are trying to ward off the recent increase in illegal activities, and are therefore imposing more restrictions on what is allowed and not.|||{{N|umar_conflict_3||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_3|The priests of the Shadow, mostly seated in Nor City, are opponents to the new restrictions, saying that they limit the ways that they can please the Shadow.|||{{N|umar_conflict_4||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_4|In turn, the rumor is that the priests of the Shadow are planning to overthrow Lord Geomyr and his forces.|||{{N|umar_conflict_5||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_5|Also, the rumor is that the priests of the Shadow are still doing their rituals, despite of them being banned.|||{{N|umar_conflict_6||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_6|Lord Geomyr and his royal guard on the other hand, are still trying their best to rule in a way that they feel is fair.|||{{N|umar_conflict_7||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_7|We in the Thieves Guild try not to get involved in the conflict. Our business is so far unaffected by all this.|||{{Thank you for telling me.|umar_return_2||||}{Whatever, that doesn\'t concern me.|umar_return_2||||}}|};
{umar_andor_1|He asked me for my support, and asked of how to find Lodar.|||{{Who is Lodar?|umar_andor_2||||}}|};
{umar_andor_2|Lodar? He is one of our famous potion makers in the Thieves Guild. He can make all sorts of strong sleeping potions, healing potions and cures.|||{{N|umar_andor_3||||}}|};
{umar_andor_3|But his specialty is, of course, his poisons. His poison can harm even the largest of monsters.|||{{What would Andor want with him?|umar_andor_4||||}}|};
{umar_andor_4|I don\'t know. Maybe he was looking for a potion.|andor:55||{{So, where can I find this Lodar?|umar_lodar_1||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_1|I really shouldn\'t tell you. How to get to him is one of our closely guarded secrets in the guild. His hideaway is only reachable by our members.|||{{N|umar_lodar_2||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_2|However, I heard that you helped us find the key of Luthor. This is something we have been trying to get to for a long time.|||{{N|umar_lodar_3||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_3|Ok, I\'ll tell you how to get to Lodar\'s Hideaway. But you have to promise to keep it a secret. Do not tell anyone. Not even those that appear to be members of the Thieves Guild.|||{{Ok, I\'ll promise to keep it a secret.|umar_lodar_4||||}{I can\'t give any guarantees, but I will try.|umar_lodar_4||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_4|Good. The thing is, you not only need to find the place itself, but you also need to utter the correct words to be allowed entry by the guardian.|||{{N|umar_lodar_5||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_5|The only one that understands the language of the guardian is the old man Ogam in Vilegard.|lodar:10||{{N|umar_lodar_6||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_6|You should travel to the town of Vilegard and find Ogam. He can help you get the right words to enter Lodar\'s Hideaway.|lodar:15||{{How do I get to Vilegard?|umar_vilegard_1||||}{Thank you. There was something else I wanted to talk about.|umar_return_2||||}{Thank you, goodbye.|X||||}}|};

{guthbered_26|A man, from the Blackwater settlement, you say?|||{{N|guthbered_27||||}}|};
{guthbered_27|Did he say anything about us here in Prim?|||{{No. But he insisted that I go straight east when exiting the mine, thus not reaching Prim.|guthbered_28||||}}|};

{buceth_5|Let\'s assume you live in a village that, for the most part, keeps to itself. Your village is self-sustainable and the crops have been good for some years.|||{{N|buceth_6||||}}|};
{buceth_6|With the few exceptions of a some fights here and there between villagers because of misunderstandings, on the whole, your village is a friendly peaceful village.|||{{N|buceth_7||||}}|};
{buceth_7|You work in the same profession as your parents, which in turn worked in the same professions as their parents.|||{{N|buceth_8||||}}|};
{buceth_8|Let\'s also assume that the way you conduct your business is the same way that the people in the village have been conducting their business for generations past.|||{{N|buceth_9||||}}|};
{buceth_9|Everyone respects one another in the village, and your appointed leader does a good job at keeping everyone\'s interests satisfied, while at the same time being reasonably fair.|||{{N|buceth_10||||}}|};
{buceth_10|Then, one day, a group of men come walking into the village. Shining armours, white teeth, combed hair, trimmed beards.|||{{N|buceth_11||||}}|};
{buceth_11|The men claim that their lord owns this land, including your village.|||{{N|buceth_12||||}}|};
{buceth_12|They claim that they keep the land safe of wrongdoers and evil creatures.|||{{N|buceth_13||||}}|};
{buceth_13|For their help in protecting your village, they ask that the village compensate them with a share of the harvest.|||{{N|buceth_14||||}}|};

{buceth_16|Let me continue the story of our hypothetical case.|||{{N|buceth_17||||}}|};
{buceth_17|A while later, the men return. They explain that some of the methods that are used in the village have now been prohibited across the whole land.|||{{N|buceth_18||||}}|};
{buceth_18|Without going into specifics, let\'s say that these are methods that have been used for past generations in your village.|||{{N|buceth_19||||}}|};
{buceth_19|Changing the way things are done without these methods will require quite an effort. A lot of people in the village are upset because of these news from the men.|||{{N|buceth_20||||}}|};
{buceth_20|Now, tell me. Would you in secret continue using the old methods your past generations have used, or would you instead convert to the way that the men are advocating?|||{

{buceth_24|You wanted to know about some business that you accuse me of. Since you have no proof, I will claim innocence. I know that my conscience is clean.|||{

	{Great. Another endless story.|buceth_story_3||||}
	{Please go ahead.|buceth_story_3||||}

{buceth_story_3|I am appointed by the priests of Nor City to help guide the people of Loneford towards the Shadow. Our mission is to see that the Shadow casts its glow over Loneford as well as other settlements around here.|||{{N|buceth_story_4||||}}|};
{buceth_story_4|Most folk in these northern parts seem too occupied with obeying the will of Feygard and Lord Geomyr. We want to help people see the light of the wrongdoings that Feygard advocates, and to point out the errors in their ways.|||{{N|buceth_story_5||||}}|};
{buceth_story_5|That\'s my mission here. To see that the Shadow casts its glow over Loneford.|||{{How does this relate to what you were doing at the well?|buceth_story_6||||}}|};
{buceth_story_6|Nor City sent word to me that something was about to happen here in Loneford. Something that would help our cause.|||{{N|buceth_story_7||||}}|};
{buceth_story_7|They were sending a boy to do some business here, and I was assigned to make sure that the mission was successful.|andor:61||{{N|buceth_story_8||||}}|};
{buceth_story_8|I was tasked with gathering samples from the water in the well and from the ground around the well. Also, I was given some vials whose contents should be poured into the well.|||{{N|buceth_story_9||||}}|};
{buceth_story_9|Apparently, the boy they sent was successful in his mission. The task that I did was also successful, if I may say so myself.|loneford:45||{{N|buceth_story_10||||}}|};
{buceth_story_10|And that\'s where we stand now. The deed is done, and the Shadow will look favorably upon us.|||{

	}|};
{buceth_story_11|Horrible!? What is horrible? What those people from Feygard are doing - that\'s what\'s horrible!|||{{N|buceth_story_12||||}}|};
{buceth_story_12|Now, I ask you to keep this story just between us two. You understand that, right?|||{
	{Absolutely. Walk with the Shadow.|buceth_story_14||||}
	{I promise not to tell anyone.|buceth_story_14||||}
	{No, I will report you to the guard.|buceth_story_13||||}

{buceth_story_13|I urge you to rethink your reasoning. The way of the Shadow is the righteous way.|||{
