	{60|I have made to the Blackwater mountain settlement. I should find and talk to their battlemaster, Harlenn.|||}
	{65|I have spoken to Harlenn in the Blackwater Mountain settlement. Apparently, the settlement is under attack by a number of monsters, the Aulaeth and white wyrms. On top of that, they are being attacked by the people of Prim.|||}
