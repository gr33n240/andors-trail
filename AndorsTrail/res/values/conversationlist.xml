{vacor_42|Now I should be able to finish the rift spell and open up the Shadow rift .. erm I mean open up new possibilities. Yes, that\'s what I meant.|||{{N|vacor_43||||}}|};
{vacor_43|The only obstacle between me and continuing my rift spell research is that stupid Unzel fellow.|||{{N|vacor_44||||}}|};
{vacor_44|Unzel was my apprentice a while ago. But he started to annoy me with his questions and talk about morality.|||{{N|vacor_45||||}}|};
{vacor_45|He said that my spell making was disrupting the will of the Shadow.|||{{N|vacor_46||||}}|};
{vacor_46|Bah, The Shadow. What has it ever done for ME?!|||{{N|vacor_47||||}}|};
{vacor_47|I shall one day cast my rift spell and we will be rid of the Shadow.|||{{N|vacor_48||||}}|};
{vacor_48|Anyway. I have a feeling that Unzel sent those bandits after me, and if I don\'t stop him he will probably send more.|||{{N|vacor_49||||}}|};
{vacor_49|I need you to find Unzel and kill him for me. He can probably be found somewhere southwest of Fallhaven.|vacor:40||{{N|vacor_50||||}}|};
{vacor_50|Bring me his signet ring as proof when you have killed him.|||{{N|vacor_51||||}}|};
{vacor_51|Now hurry, I cannot wait much longer. The power shall be MINE!||||};
{vacor_return2|Hello again. Any progress yet?|||{{About Unzel...|vacor_return2_2||||}{Could you tell me the story again?|vacor_43||||}}|};

{vacor_return_complete|Hello again, my assassin friend. I will soon have my rift spell ready.||||};
{vacor_70|What? He told you his story? And you actually believed it?|||{{N|vacor_71||||}}|};
{vacor_71|I will give you one more chance. Either kill Unzel for me, and I will reward you handsomely, or you will have to fight me.|||{{No. You must be stopped.|vacor_72||||}{Ok, I\'ll think about it once more.|X||||}}|};

{flagstone_sentry_8|For years, no one took notice of Flagstone. Except for the occasional reports from travelers of terrible screams coming from the camp.|||{{N|flagstone_sentry_9||||}}|};

{umar_novisit_1|Hello. How did your search go?|||{{What search?|umar_2||||}}|};
{umar_2|Last time we talked, you asked for the way to Lodar\'s Hideaway. Did you find it?|||{{We have never met.|umar_3||||}{You must have me confused with my brother Andor. We look very much alike.|umar_4||||}}|};
{umar_3|Oh. I must have you mixed up with someone else.|||{{My brother Andor and I look very much alike.|umar_4||||}}|};
{umar_4|Really? Never mind I said anything then.|andor:51||{{I guess that means that Andor was here. What was he doing?|umar_5||||}}|};
{umar_5|He came here a while ago, asking a lot of questions about what relation the Thieves Guild has to the Shadow and to the royal guard in Feygard.|||{{N|umar_6||||}}|};
{umar_6|We in the Thieves Guild really don\'t care much for the Shadow. Nor do we care for the royal guard.|||{{N|umar_7||||}}|};
{umar_7|We try to be above their bickering and differences. They may fight as much as they want, but the Thieves Guild will outlive them all.|||{{What conflict?|umar_conflict_1||||}{Tell me more about what Andor asked for|umar_andor_1||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_1|Where have you been the last couple of years? Don\'t you know of the brewing conflict?|||{{N|umar_conflict_2||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_2|The royal guard, led by Lord Geomyr in Feygard, are trying to ward off the recent increase in illegal activities, and are therefore imposing more restrictions on what is allowed and not.|||{{N|umar_conflict_3||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_3|The priests of the Shadow, mostly seated in Nor City, are opponents to the new restrictions, saying that they limit the ways that they can please the Shadow.|||{{N|umar_conflict_4||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_4|In turn, the rumor is that the priests of the Shadow are planning to overthrow Lord Geomyr and his forces.|||{{N|umar_conflict_5||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_5|Also, the rumor is that the priests of the Shadow are still doing their rituals, despite of them being banned.|||{{N|umar_conflict_6||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_6|Lord Geomyr and his royal guard on the other hand, are still trying their best to rule in a way that they feel is fair.|||{{N|umar_conflict_7||||}}|};
{umar_conflict_7|We in the Thieves Guild try not to get involved in the conflict. Our business is so far unaffected by all this.|||{{Thank you for telling me.|umar_return_2||||}{Whatever, that doesn\'t concern me.|umar_return_2||||}}|};
{umar_andor_1|He asked me for my support, and asked of how to find Lodar.|||{{Who is Lodar?|umar_andor_2||||}}|};
{umar_andor_2|Lodar? He is one of our famous potion makers in the Thieves Guild. He can make all sorts of strong sleeping potions, healing potions and cures.|||{{N|umar_andor_3||||}}|};
{umar_andor_3|But his specialty is, of course, his poisons. His poison can harm even the largest of monsters.|||{{What would Andor want with him?|umar_andor_4||||}}|};
{umar_andor_4|I don\'t know. Maybe he was looking for a potion.|andor:55||{{So, where can I find this Lodar?|umar_lodar_1||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_1|I really shouldn\'t tell you. How to get to him is one of our closely guarded secrets in the guild. His hideaway is only reachable by our members.|||{{N|umar_lodar_2||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_2|However, I heard that you helped us find the key of Luthor. This is something we have been trying to get to for a long time.|||{{N|umar_lodar_3||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_3|Ok, I\'ll tell you how to get to Lodar\'s Hideaway. But you have to promise to keep it a secret. Do not tell anyone. Not even those that appear to be members of the Thieves Guild.|||{{Ok, I\'ll promise to keep it a secret.|umar_lodar_4||||}{I can\'t give any guarantees, but I will try.|umar_lodar_4||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_4|Good. The thing is, you not only need to find the place itself, but you also need to utter the correct words to be allowed entry by the guardian.|||{{N|umar_lodar_5||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_5|The only one that understands the language of the guardian is the old man Ogam in Vilegard.|lodar:10||{{N|umar_lodar_6||||}}|};
{umar_lodar_6|You should travel to the town of Vilegard and find Ogam. He can help you get the right words to enter Lodar\'s Hideaway.|lodar:15||{{How do I get to Vilegard?|umar_vilegard_1||||}{Thank you. There was something else I wanted to talk about.|umar_return_2||||}{Thank you, goodbye.|X||||}}|};
