{vacor_43|The only obstacle left for me now before I can continue researching my rift spell is that stupid Unzel fellow.|||Next|vacor_44||||||||||||||};
{vacor_44|Unzel was my apprentice a while ago. But he started to annoy me with his questions and talk about morality.|||Next|vacor_45||||||||||||||};
{vacor_45|He said that my spellmaking was disrupting the will of the Shadow.|||Next|vacor_46||||||||||||||};
{vacor_46|Bah, the Shadow. What use have we ever had of the Shadow?|||Next|vacor_47||||||||||||||};
{vacor_47|I shall one day cast my rift spell and we will be rid of the Shadow.|||Next|vacor_48||||||||||||||};
{vacor_48|Anyway. I have a feeling that Unzel sent those bandits for me, and if I don\'t stop him he will probably send more.|||Next|vacor_49||||||||||||||};
{vacor_49|I need you to find Unzel and kill him for me. He can probably be found somewhere southeast of Fallhaven.|vacor:40||Next|vacor_50||||||||||||||};

{unzel_10|Vacor and I used to travel together. But he started to get obsessed with his spellmaking.|||Next|unzel_11||||||||||||||};
{unzel_11|He even started to question the Shadow. I knew there was something I had to do to stop him.|||Next|unzel_12||||||||||||||};
{unzel_12|I started questioning him about what he was up to, but he just wanted to keep on going.|||Next|unzel_13||||||||||||||};
{unzel_13|After a while, he became obsessed with the thought of a rift spell that he said would grant him unlimited powers against the Shadow.|||Next|unzel_14||||||||||||||};
{unzel_14|So there was only one thing I could do. I left him and neede to put an end to his making of the rift spell.|||Next|unzel_15||||||||||||||};
