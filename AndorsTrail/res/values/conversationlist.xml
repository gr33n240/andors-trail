{vacor_begin|Hello.|||N|vacor_2||||||||||||||};
{vacor_2|What are you, some kind of adventurer? Hm. Maybe you can be of use to me.|||N|vacor_3||||||||||||||};
{vacor_3|Are you willing to help me?|||Sure, what do you need help with?|vacor_4||||No, why should I help you?|vacor_bah|||||||||};
{vacor_bah|Bah, lowly creature. I knew I shouldn\'t have asked you. Now leave me.||||||||||||||||||};
{vacor_4|A while ago, I was working on a rift spell that I had read about.|||N|vacor_5||||||||||||||};
{vacor_5|The spell is supposed to, shall we say, open up new possibilities.|||N|vacor_6||||||||||||||};
{vacor_6|Erm, yes, the rift spell will open things up allright. Ahem.|||N|vacor_7||||||||||||||};
{vacor_7|So there I was working hard on getting the last pieces together for it.|||N|vacor_8||||||||||||||};
{vacor_8|Then all of a sudden, a gang of thugs came around and started bullying me.|||N|vacor_9||||||||||||||};
{vacor_9|They said they were messengers of the Shadow, and insisted that I should cease my spell making.|||N|vacor_10||||||||||||||};
{vacor_10|Preposterous, isn\'t it? I was so close to having the power!|||N|vacor_11||||||||||||||};
{vacor_11|Oh the power I could have had. My dear rift spell.|vacor:10||N|vacor_12||||||||||||||};
{vacor_12|Anyway, I was just about to finish the last piece of my rift spell when the bandits came and robbed me.|||N|vacor_13||||||||||||||};
{vacor_13|The bandits took my recipe for the spell and took off before I could call the guards.|||N|vacor_14||||||||||||||};
{vacor_14|Now I can\'t seem to remember the last parts of it.|||N|vacor_15||||||||||||||};
{vacor_15|Do you think you could help me locate it? Then I could have the power at last!|||N|vacor_16||||||||||||||};
{vacor_16|You will of course be suitably rewarded for your part in me getting this power.|||A reward? I\'m in!|vacor_17||||Very well. I will help you.|vacor_17||||No thanks, this seems like something that I would rather not get involved with.|vacor_bah||||};
{vacor_17|I knew I couldn\'t trust... Wait, what? You actually said yes? Hah, well then.|||N|vacor_18||||||||||||||};
{vacor_18|Ok, find the four pieces of my rift spell that the bandits took, and bring them to me.|vacor:20||N|vacor_19||||||||||||||};
{vacor_19|There were four bandits, and they all headed south of Fallhaven when I was attacked.|||N|vacor_20||||||||||||||};
{vacor_20|You should search the southern parts of Fallhaven for the four bandits.|||N|vacor_21||||||||||||||};
{vacor_21|Please hurry! I am so eager to open up the rift.. Erm, I mean finish the spell. Nothing odd with that right?||||||||||||||||||};
{vacor_return1|Hello again. How is the search for my missing pieces of the rift spell going?|||I have found all pieces.|vacor_40||vacor_spell|4|What was I supposed to do again?|vacor_18||||Could you tell me the whole story again?|vacor_4||||};
{vacor_40|Oh, you found all four pieces? Hurry, give them to me.|vacor:30||N|vacor_41||||||||||||||};
{vacor_41|Yes, these are the pieces that the bandits took.|||N|vacor_42||||||||||||||};
{vacor_42|Now I should be able to finish the rift spell and open up the Shadow rift .. erm I mean open up new possibilities. Yes, that\'s what I meant.|||N|vacor_43||||||||||||||};
{vacor_43|The only obstacle between me and continuing my rift spell research is that stupid Unzel fellow.|||N|vacor_44||||||||||||||};
{vacor_44|Unzel was my apprentice a while ago. But he started to annoy me with his questions and talk about morality.|||N|vacor_45||||||||||||||};
{vacor_45|He said that my spell making was disrupting the will of the Shadow.|||N|vacor_46||||||||||||||};
{vacor_46|Bah, the Shadow. What has it ever done for ME?!|||N|vacor_47||||||||||||||};
{vacor_47|I shall one day cast my rift spell and we will be rid of the Shadow.|||N|vacor_48||||||||||||||};
{vacor_48|Anyway. I have a feeling that Unzel sent those bandits after me, and if I don\'t stop him he will probably send more.|||N|vacor_49||||||||||||||};
{vacor_49|I need you to find Unzel and kill him for me. He can probably be found somewhere southwest of Fallhaven.|vacor:40||N|vacor_50||||||||||||||};
{vacor_50|Bring me his signet ring as proof when you have killed him.|||N|vacor_51||||||||||||||};
{vacor_51|Now hurry, I cannot wait much longer. The power shall be MINE!||||||||||||||||||};
{vacor_return2|Hello again. Any progress yet?|||About Unzel...|vacor_return2_2||||Could you tell me the story again?|vacor_43|||||||||};
{vacor_return2_2|Have you killed Unzel for me yet? Bring me his signet ring when you have killed him.|||I have dealt with him. Here is his ring.|vacor_60||ring_unzel|1|I listened to Unzel\'s story and have decided to side with him. The Shadow must be preserved.|vacor_70|vacor:51||||vacor_return2||||};
{vacor_60|Haha, Unzel is dead! That pathetic creature is gone!|vacor:60||N|vacor_61||||||||||||||};
{vacor_61|I can see the blood on your boots. And I even got you to kill his minions beforehand.|||N|vacor_62||||||||||||||};
{vacor_62|This is a great day indeed. I will soon have the power!|||N|vacor_63||||||||||||||};
{vacor_63|Here, have these coins for your help.||gold200|N|vacor_64||||||||||||||};
{vacor_64|Now leave me, I have work to do before I can cast the rift spell.||||||||||||||||||};
{vacor_return_complete|Hello again, my assassin friend. I will soon have my rift spell ready.||||||||||||||||||};
{vacor_70|What? He told you his story? And you actually believed it?|||N|vacor_71||||||||||||||};
{vacor_71|I will give you one more chance. Either you kill Unzel for me, and I will reward you handsomely. Or you will have to fight me.|||No. You must be stopped.|vacor_72||||Ok, I\'ll think about it once more.|X|||||||||};
{vacor_72|Bah, lowly creature. I knew I shouldn\'t have trusted you. Now you will die along with your precious Shadow.|vacor:54||For the Shadow!|F||||You must be stopped.|F|||||||||};

{unzel_3|Vacor sent you huh? I guess I should have figured he would send someone sooner or later.|||N|unzel_4||||||||||||||};
{unzel_4|Very well then. Kill me if you must, or allow me to tell you my side of the story.|||Hah, I will enjoy killing you!|unzel_fight||||I will listen to your story.|unzel_5|||||||||};
{unzel_fight|Very well, let\'s fight then.|vacor:53||A fight it is!|F||||||||||||||};
{unzel_5|Thank you for listening.|||N|unzel_10||||||||||||||};
{unzel_10|Vacor and I used to travel together. But he started to get obsessed with his spell making.|||N|unzel_11||||||||||||||};
{unzel_11|He even started to question the Shadow. I knew I had to do something to stop him!|||N|unzel_12||||||||||||||};
{unzel_12|I started questioning him about what he was up to, but he just wanted to keep on going.|||N|unzel_13||||||||||||||};
{unzel_13|After a while, he became obsessed with the thought of a rift spell that he said would grant him unlimited powers against the Shadow.|||N|unzel_14||||||||||||||};
{unzel_14|So there was only one thing I could do. I left him and needed to put an end to him trying to create the rift spell.|||N|unzel_15||||||||||||||};
{unzel_15|So I sent some friends over to him to take the spell from him.|||N|unzel_16_select||||||||||||||};
{unzel_16_select|||||unzel_16_2|vacor:50||||unzel_16_1|||||||||};
{unzel_16_1|And here we are.|||I killed the four bandits you sent after Vacor.|unzel_17||||||||||||||};

{unzel_17|What? You killed my four friends? Argh, I feel the rage coming.|||N|unzel_18||||||||||||||};
{unzel_18|But I also realize that all this is the making of Vacor. I\'ll give you a choice now. Choose wisely.|||N|unzel_19||||||||||||||};
{unzel_19|Either you side with Vacor and his rift spell, or you help me get rid of him. Who will you help?|vacor:50||I will side with you. The shadow must not be disturbed.|unzel_20||||I will side with Vacor.|unzel_fight|||||||||};
{unzel_20|Thank you my friend. We will keep the Shadow safe from Vacor.|vacor:51||N|unzel_21||||||||||||||};

{flagstone_sentry_3|Flagstone has been overrun by undead, and I\'m standing guard here to make sure no undead escape.|||Can you tell me the story about Flagstone?|flagstone_sentry_4||||||||||||||};
{flagstone_sentry_4|Flagstone used to be a prison camp for runaway workers from when Mount Galmore was dug out.|||N|flagstone_sentry_5||||||||||||||};
{flagstone_sentry_5|But once the digging in Mount Galmore stopped, the prison camp lost its purpose.|||N|flagstone_sentry_6||||||||||||||};
{flagstone_sentry_6|The lord at the time did not care much for the prisoners that were already in Flagstone, so he left them there.|||N|flagstone_sentry_7||||||||||||||};
{flagstone_sentry_7|The warden that ran Flagstone on the other hand took his duty very seriously, and kept on running the prison just like it was when Mount Galmore was being dug out.|||N|flagstone_sentry_8||||||||||||||};
{flagstone_sentry_8|For years, no one took notice of Flagstone. Except for the occasional reports by travelers on this road of terrible screams coming from the camp.|||N|flagstone_sentry_9||||||||||||||};

{flagstone_sentry_10|And here we are. I have to guard the road from undead, so that they do not spread farther than Flagstone.|||N|flagstone_sentry_11||||||||||||||};

{flagstone_sentry_return1|Hello again. Did you enter Flagstone? I am surprised you actually returned.|||Can you tell me the story again?|flagstone_sentry_4||||There is a guardian in the lower levels of Flagstone that cannot be approached.|flagstone_sentry_20|flagstone:20||||||||};
{flagstone_sentry_20|A guardian you say? This is troubling news, since it means there is some larger force behind all this.|||N|flagstone_sentry_21||||||||||||||};

{flagstone_sentry_43|Well, keep looking. Return to me if you need my advice.||||||||||||||||||};
{flagstone_sentry_return4|Hello again. It seems something happened inside Flagstone that made the undead weaker. I\'m sure we have you to thank for it.||||||||||||||||||};

{farrik_2|I\'m Farrik, Umar\'s brother.|||What do you do around here?|farrik_3||||What can you tell me about the thieves guild?|farrik_4|||||||||};
{farrik_3|I mostly manage our trading with other guilds and keep an eye on what the thieves need to be as effective as they can be.|||What can you tell me about the thieves guild?|farrik_4||||||||||||||};
{farrik_4|We try to keep to ourselves as much as possible, and help other fellow thieves as much as possible.|||Any recent events happening?|farrik_5||||||||||||||};
{farrik_5|Well, there was one thing a few weeks ago. One of our guildmembers got arrested for trespassing.|||N|farrik_6||||||||||||||};
{farrik_6|The patrol guard in Fallhaven has really started to get annoyed at us lately. Probably because we have been very successful in our recent missions.|||N|farrik_7||||||||||||||};
{farrik_7|The patrol guard therefore increased their security lately, leading to them arresting one of our members.|||N|farrik_8||||||||||||||};
{farrik_8|He is currently held in the prison here in Fallhaven, pending transfer to Feygard.|||What did he do?|farrik_9||||||||||||||};
{farrik_9|Oh, nothing serious. He was trying to get into the catacombs beneath Fallhaven church.|||N|farrik_10||||||||||||||};
{farrik_10|But now that you have helped us with that mission, I guess we don\'t need to go there anymore.|||N|farrik_11||||||||||||||};

{farrik_20a|Our cook can help you prepare a special brew of mead that will knock him out.|||N|farrik_21||||||||||||||};

{umar_4|Really? Never mind I said anything then.|andor:51||I guess that means that Andor was here. What was he doing?|umar_5||||||||||||||};
{umar_5|He came here a while ago, asking a lot of questions about what relation the thieves guild have to the Shadow and to the royal guard in Feygard.|||N|umar_6||||||||||||||};
{umar_6|We in the Thieves Guild really don\'t care much for the Shadow. Nor do we care for the royal guard.|||N|umar_7||||||||||||||};
{umar_7|We try to be above their bickering and differences. They may fight as much as they want, but the Thieves Guild will outlive them all.|||What conflict?|umar_conflict_1||||Tell me more about what Andor asked for|umar_andor_1|||||||||};
{umar_conflict_1|Where have you been the last couple of years? Don\'t you know of the brewing conflict?|||N|umar_conflict_2||||||||||||||};
{umar_conflict_2|The royal guard, led by Lord Geomyr in Feygard, are trying to ward off the recent increase in illegal activities, and are therefore imposing a lot more restrictions on what is allowed and not.|||N|umar_conflict_3||||||||||||||};
{umar_conflict_3|The priests of the Shadow, mostly seated in Nor City, are opponents to the new restrictions, saying that they limit the ways that they can please the Shadow.|||N|umar_conflict_4||||||||||||||};
{umar_conflict_4|In turn, the rumor is that the priests of the Shadow are planning to overthrow Lord Geomyr and his forces.|||N|umar_conflict_5||||||||||||||};

{umar_lodar_1|I really shouldn\'t tell you. How to get to him is one of our closely guarded secrets in the guild. His hideaway is only reachable by our members.|||N|umar_lodar_2||||||||||||||};
{umar_lodar_2|However, I heard that you helped us find the key of Luthor. This is something we have been trying to get to for a long time.|||N|umar_lodar_3||||||||||||||};
{umar_lodar_3|Ok, I\'ll tell you how to get to Lodar\'s Hideaway. But you have to promise to keep it a secret. Do not tell anyone. Not even those that appear to be members of the Thieves Guild.|||Ok, I\'ll promise to keep it a secret.|umar_lodar_4||||I can\'t give any guarantees, but I will try.|umar_lodar_4|||||||||};
{umar_lodar_4|Good. The thing is, you not only need to find the place itself, but you also need to utter the correct words to be allowed entry by the guardian.|||N|umar_lodar_5||||||||||||||};
{umar_lodar_5|The only one that understands the language of the guardian is the old man Ogam in Vilegard.|lodar:10||N|umar_lodar_6||||||||||||||};
{umar_lodar_6|You should travel to the town of Vilegard and find Ogam. He can help you get the right words to enter Lodar\'s Hideaway.|lodar:15||How do I get to Vilegard?|umar_vilegard_1||||Thank you. There was something else I wanted to talk about.|umar_return_2||||Thank you, goodbye.|X||||};

{ff_outsideguard_trouble_8|Right. I like you kid. Tell you what, I could put in a good word for you in the barracks when we get back to Feygard if you want.|||Sure, that sounds good to me.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_20||||No thanks. I have enough to do already.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_20|||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_9|Well, I am convinced that we must follow the laws laid down by our rulers. If we don\'t obey they laws, what are we left with?|||N|ff_outsideguard_trouble_10||||||||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_10|Chaos. No order.\n\nNo, I prefer the lawful way of Feygard. My loyalty is firm.|||Sounds good to me. Laws are made to be followed.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_8||||I do not agree. We should follow our heart, even if that goes against the rules.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_12|||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_20|Was there anything else you wanted?|||I was wondering about why you stand guard here.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_21||||||||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_12|That troubles me. We might see each other again in the future. But then we might not be able to have this kind of civil discussion.||||||||||||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_21|Right, we went over this before. As I said, I would rather be inside by the fire.|||I could spot for you if you want to go inside.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_23||||Tough luck. I guess you are left here, while your captain and buddies are inside.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_22|||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_22|Yeah, that\'s just my luck.||||||||||||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_23|Really? Yes that would be great. Then I can at least get something to eat and a bit of warmth from the fire.|||N|ff_outsideguard_trouble_24||||||||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_24|I will go inside in a minute. You are welcome to stand watch then while I go inside.|jolnor:20||Sure, I will do that.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_25||||[Lie] Sure, I will do that.|ff_outsideguard_trouble_25|||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_trouble_25|Thanks a lot my friend.||||||||||||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_shadow_1|Shadow? How curious that you would mention that. Explain yourself!|||I did not mean anything by it. Nevermind I said anything.|ff_outsideguard_shadow_2||||The Shadow watches over us when we sleep.|ff_outsideguard_shadow_3|||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_shadow_2|Good. Now begone before I will have to deal with you.||||||||||||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_shadow_3|What? Are you one of those troublemakers sent here to sabotage our mission?|||The Shadow protect us.|ff_outsideguard_shadow_4||||Fine. I better not start a fight with the royal guard.|X|||||||||};
{ff_outsideguard_shadow_4|That does it. You better fight or flee right now kid.|||Good. I have been waiting for a fight!|ff_outsideguard_shadow_5||||For the Shadow!|ff_outsideguard_shadow_5||||Nevermind. I was just kidding with you.|ff_outsideguard_shadow_2||||};

{wrye_mourn_4|Please leave me.\n\nOh Shadow, watch over me.||||||||||||||||||};
{wrye_mourn_5|My son is dead, I know it! And it\'s those damn guards fault. Those guards with their snobby Feygard attitude.|||N|wrye_mourn_6||||||||||||||};
{wrye_mourn_6|At first they come with promise of protection and power. But then you really start to see them for what they are.|||N|wrye_mourn_7||||||||||||||};

{wrye_mourn_8|Thank you. Shadow watch over me.|||N|wrye_story_1||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_1|It all started with those Feygard royal guards coming here.|||N|wrye_story_2||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_2|They tried to pressure everyone in Vilegard into recruiting more soldiers.|||N|wrye_story_3||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_3|The guards would say they needed more support to help squelch the supposed uprising and sabotage.|||How did this relate to your son?|wrye_story_4||||Are you going to get to the point soon?|wrye_story_4|||||||||};
{wrye_story_4|My son, Rincel, did not seem to care much for the stories they told.|||N|wrye_story_5||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_5|I also told Rincel of how bad idea I thought it was to recruit more people to the royal guard.|||N|wrye_story_6||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_6|The guards stayed a couple of days to talk to everyone here in Vilegard. Then they left. Went to the next town I guess.|||N|wrye_story_7||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_7|A few of days passed, and then suddenly my boy Rincel was gone one day. I am sure those guards managed to somehow persuade him to join them.|||N|wrye_story_8||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_8|Oh how I despise those evil and snobby Feygard bastards.|||What now?|wrye_story_9||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_9|This was several weeks ago. Now I feel an emptiness inside. I know in me that something has happened to my son Rincel.|||N|wrye_story_10||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_10|I fear he has died or got hurt somehow. Those bastards probably drove him into his own death.|wrye:30||N|wrye_story_11||||||||||||||};
{wrye_story_11|*sob* Shadow help me.|||What can I do to help?|wrye_story_13||||That sounds awful. I am sure you are just imagining things.|wrye_story_13||||But you have no proof that the people from Feygard are involved?|wrye_story_12||||};
{wrye_story_12|I know it in me that they are. The Shadow speaks to me.|||Ok. Is there anything I can do to help?|wrye_story_13||||You sound a bit too occupied with the Shadow.

{wrye_story_13|If you want to help me, please find out what happened to my son Rincel.|wrye:40||Any idea where I should look?|wrye_story_16||||Ok. I will go look for your son.

{wrye_story_15|Walk with the Shadow.||||||||||||||||||};

{wrye_resolved_1|Please tell me what happened to him!|||He left Vilegard by his own will because he wanted to see the great city of Feygard.|wrye_resolved_2||||||||||||||};
{wrye_resolved_2|I don\'t believe it.|||He had secretly longed to go to Feygard, but didn\'t dare tell you.|wrye_resolved_3||||||||||||||};
{wrye_resolved_3|Really?|||But he never got far. He got attacked while camping one night.|wrye_resolved_4||||||||||||||};
{wrye_resolved_4|Attacked?|||Yes, he could not stand up to the monsters, and was critically wounded.|wrye_resolved_5||||||||||||||};
{wrye_resolved_5|My dear boy.|||I talked to a man that found him bleeding to death.|wrye_resolved_6||||||||||||||};
{wrye_resolved_6|He was still alive?|||Yes, but not for long. He could not survive the wounds. He is now buried to the northwest of Vilegard.|wrye_resolved_7||||||||||||||};

{oluag_grave_2|Well, when I say \'nothing\', I really mean nothing. Or maybe just a little bit.|||A little bit?|oluag_grave_3||||||||||||||};

{oluag_grave_9|Yeah, that might be it. Anyway, so he said something about fulfilling a dream to see the great city of Feygard.|||N|oluag_grave_10||||||||||||||};
{oluag_grave_10|And he told me something about that he didn\'t dare tell anyone.|||Maybe he didn\'t dare tell Wrye?|oluag_grave_11||||||||||||||};
{oluag_grave_11|Yeah sure, probably. He had set down here to camp, but got attacked by some monsters.|||N|oluag_grave_12||||||||||||||};
{oluag_grave_12|Apparently he was not as strong a fighter as, for example, someone like me. So the monsters wounded him too much for him to last the night.|||N|oluag_grave_13||||||||||||||};
